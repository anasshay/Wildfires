        <h2>Wildfires map and fatalities:</h2>
        <p>In recent weeks, the devastating effects of wildfires, which have killed more than 100 people and rendered
            thousands homeless, have been dominating headlines around the world.
            Several countries have reported their worst fires in decades, including hundreds of deadly fires across the
            Mediterranean. In Algeria, at least 90 people have been killed.

            Restoration & Regrowth After Wildfire
        </h2>
        <p>During high-intensity forest fires, soil temperatures can top 500 degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit),
            which leads to the loss of soil nutrients .So the forest soils recover from disturbances slowly over many
            years — up to 80 years following a wildfire .</p>
        <p>But Long-lasting declines in soil nutrients such as nitrate, phosphorus and organic carbon could have flow-on
            effects on the functional roles soils have.</p>
        <p>
            Then, and the harrowing aftermath of a major wildfire, it may be difficult to appreciate the restorative
            power in the fire itself. Especially when nothing remains to hold the land in place .

            There are many ways to help the forests and start Restoration & Regrowth After Wildfire:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>No External</h4>
                <p>Simple , sometimes having no external intervention is what nature requires after a
                    wildfire.</p>
            </li>

                    vegetation to grow in the charred areas. Seeds stored in the forest floor begin to germinate. Some
                    trees begin to sprout branches from basal buds of dead trees.</p>

                <p>Start planting trees immediately, and instead of trees that dominate the region, plant different
